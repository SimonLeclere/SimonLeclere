# Hi there 👋

I'm Simon, a young student with a passion for computers and new technologies!
Kind of like the guy in [Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), I spend my days imagining and developing systems to make the world a better place!

Want to support me? -> 🍺 [Buy me a ~~coffee~~ beer](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/SimonLeclere)
