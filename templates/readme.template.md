# Hi there 👋

I'm Simon, a french student with a passion for computers and new technologies! I'm currently studying at INSA Centre-Val-de-Loire, a French engineering school.
Kind of like the guy in [Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), I spend my days imagining and developing weird things, but I'm pretty proud of it :)
